# SARS-CoV-2_parameter_reliability

We evaluated the reliability of estimates of key model parameters when viral load data prior to the viral load peak is missing. We estimated the time from infection to peak viral load by fitting non-linear mixed models to a dataset with frequent viral RNA measurements, including pre-peak; 25 individuals selected from the National Basketball Association (NBA), where testing for SARS-CoV-2 was done regularly representing the entire course of infection. We quantified the reliability of estimated infection times, key model parameters, and the time to peak viral load. Although estimates of the time of infection are sensitive to the quality and amount of available data, other parameters important in understanding disease pathogenesis, such as the loss rate of infected cells, are less sensitive. We find a lack of data in the exponential growth phase underestimates the time to peak viral load by several days, leading to a shorter predicted exponential growth phase. On the other hand, having an idea of the time of infection and fixing it results in relatively good estimates of dynamical parameters even in the absence of early data.
