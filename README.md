# SARS-CoV-2_parameter_reliability

We evaluated the reliability of estimates of key model parameters when viral load data before the viral load peak is missing. We estimated the time from infection to peak viral load by fitting non-linear mixed models to a dataset with frequent viral RNA measurements, including pre-peak; 25 individuals selected from the National Basketball Association (NBA), where testing for SARS-CoV-2 was done regularly representing the entire course of infection. 

The model was implemented and fitted in [Monolix](https://monolix.lixoft.com/) to frequent viral RNA measurements from the NBA.
